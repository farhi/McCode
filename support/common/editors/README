Code for setting up editors for McStas and McXtrace (Collectively known as McCode) syntax highlighting

The editor shipped with McStas and McXtrace GUIs has syntax highlighting built-in.

If you experience difficulties with the built in editor or simply prefer something else, any editor of your choice
may be used. Below are instructions for getting McCode-specific syntax highlighting for a few popular choices.
Note that McStas/McXtrace-syntax is very close to c, so as a fallback a c-mode
is a good solution.

NEDIT:
nedit should be copied to a .nedit file in your home directory

GEDIT (Gnome):
Gedit uses gtksourceview. The syntax definition file should be copied in e.g. (Correct path on a Debian system)
  mccode3.lang -> /usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/ 

(X)EMACS:
As noted McStas/McXtrace is not C only, but quite close. The contents of the 
provided emacs file should be entered in your .emacs file, setting font-lock-mode by
default and using the standard c-mode for McCode .instr files.
Note: Works also on Win32, copy the .emacs file to c:\ :-)

VISUAL STUDIO CODE:
This extension can either be installed via the vs code extension marketplace, or the vsix file.

Instructions for installing the extension for visual studio code can be found on https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace under "Install from a VSIX".
The vsix file in this folder is the one that should be installed as an extension.
The syntax highlighter uses syntax highlighting from C and like the other syntax highlighters, adds more keywords to the code that is McStas specific.
The extension also adds support for inserting components in a gui like fashion. 
On startup you will be prompted to choosee a folder. This should be your mcstas resource folder, where all the component definitions are located.
